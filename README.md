# BigBlue-EDA-Project-DS-Salaries
Repository for the first Exploratory Data Analysis project during my Big Blue Data Academy Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp 2023 studies.
As an upcoming Data Scientist, I focused on Data Science Salaries using the Kaggle dataset with data from 2020-2023.

#### Dataset used: [Data Science Salaries 2023 ðŸ’¸](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnabchaki/data-science-salaries-2023)
#### Data Science Job Salaries Dataset contains 11 columns, each are:

1. work_year: The year the salary was paid.
2. experience_level: The experience level in the job during the year
3. employment_type: The type of employment for the role
4. job_title: The role worked in during the year.
5. salary: The total gross salary amount paid.
6. salary_currency: The currency of the salary paid as an ISO 4217 currency code.
7. salaryinusd: The salary in USD
8. employee_residence: Employee's primary country of residence in during the work year as an ISO 3166 country code.
9. remote_ratio: The overall amount of work done remotely
10. company_location: The country of the employer's main office or contracting branch
11. company_size: The median number of people that worked for the company during the year



### Results:
- Most common data entries concern Medium-sized companies, Senior Level Employees, Full-time
- As a result of the 2020-2022 pandemic, there was a surge in the prevalence of remote working. However, this trend began to decline in 2023. Smaller-scale companies tend to adopt remote working practices more frequently.
- Pandemic also, accelerated the boom in data-related roles as salaries increased every year (from 2020 to 2023)
- Data Engineering & Data Science related roles are the most common and profitable 
- The significant number of outliers might be attributed to individuals who are delivering outstanding performances and therefore earning more than their counterparts. This insight indicates the existence of high achievers each year, resulting in elevated salary figures.

### Conclusion:
- Israel & USA seems the most prominent for those pursuing top-tier compensation in Data Science (Home to some of the world's leading tech hubs). Living and working in these countries can boost your career.
- Specializations that are related to Data Engineering & Science lead to a higher salary than Analysts, pointing out the increasing demand of the market.
- A seniority level is needed even though talents attract higher salaries, neglecting work experience. 
  
All the insights that came from this dataset are listed in the Notebook and through some slides from our presentation below.
